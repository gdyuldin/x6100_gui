 *  WSPR spectrum for the waterfall display
 *
 *  Separate from wspr_demod.c on purpose. That file carries the
 *  synchroniser and the soft decision path that were tuned by
 *  measurement and verified on air; a display feature has no business
 *  reaching into it. The cost is a second, much smaller FFT here.
 *
 *  Input is the 375 Hz complex baseband the worker already produces, so
 *  no extra filtering or decimation is needed. A 256 point transform on
 *  it gives 1.4648 Hz bins - exactly the WSPR tone spacing - across a
 *  375 Hz span, and one line per 256 samples means one line per symbol
 *  period, 0.683 s. A whole transmission is then 162 lines, which fills
 *  the display height at a natural rate.
 *
 *  Output is in dB relative to the median of the same line, so the
 *  noise floor sits near zero whatever the audio gain and RF gain
 *  happen to be. The alternative, absolute dBFS, would need the display
 *  range retuned every time the operator touched a knob.
