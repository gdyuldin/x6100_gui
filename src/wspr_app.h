 *  Xiegu X6100 LVGL GUI - WSPR application layer
 *
 *  Ties the protocol modules to the radio: audio in from a DSP
 *  subscription, decoded spots out to the window that owns it, and
 *  scheduled transmissions.
 *
 *  WSPR is a beacon mode. Stations transmit in the 120 s slot aligned to
 *  even UTC minutes, starting one second in, and listen the rest of the
 *  time. The operator chooses how often to transmit and with how much
 *  power.
 *
 *  Two separate settings:
 *
 *    - the transmit period, "one slot in N", which decides how often
 *    - the transmit power in milliwatts, which decides how hard
 *
 *  The power is applied to the radio for the duration of the
 *  transmission only, and the operator's normal setting is put back
 *  afterwards.
