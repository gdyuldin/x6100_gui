 *  Fano sequential decoder for the WSPR convolutional code
 *
 *  Written from scratch against the public description of the Fano
 *  algorithm (sequential decoding of convolutional codes, R. M. Fano
 *  1963) and the public G4JNT WSPR specification. The reference fano.c
 *  (KA9Q / K1JT, part of wsprd) is GPL and was NOT copied.
 *
 *  Why Fano rather than Viterbi: with constraint length K=32 Viterbi
 *  would need 2^31 states, which is out of the question. Sequential
 *  decoding explores only promising branches, at the price of variable
 *  run time - very fast on a strong signal, and it may give up once the
 *  step budget runs out on a weak one.

 *             magnitude is the confidence. The absolute scale does not
 *             matter, the metric is normalised internally.
 * bits81    : output, 81 bits. The last 31 should come out zero; if

 * max_nodes : work limit, 0 means WSPR_FANO_MAX_NODES.
 * nodes_used: optional (may be NULL), how many nodes were visited,
 *             a useful measure of how hard the signal was.
 *
 * Returns 0 on success, -1 if the decoder gave up.
 *
 * NOTE: reaching the end of the tree does NOT mean the result is right.
 * WSPR carries no checksum and the tail bits are forced, so on a noisy
 * input the decoder will find some path. The result must be checked
 * with wspr_verify(); otherwise false decodes get through, which in
 * WSPR is worse than no decode because they end up in the global
 * spotting database.
