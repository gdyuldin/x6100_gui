 *  Xiegu X6100 LVGL GUI - WSPR receive / transmit worker
 *
 *  Owns the WSPR decoder thread and the realtime audio ring buffer that
 *  feeds it. Modelled on ft8/audio_worker.c: cooperative shutdown via an
 *  atomic stop flag plus a condition variable, never pthread_cancel.
 *
 *  Two things differ from the FT8 worker.
 *
 *  The slot is 120 s rather than 15 s, and a transmission starts one
 *  second into an even UTC minute rather than at the slot boundary.
 *
 *  Audio is not retained. 114 s at 12000 Hz would be 5.5 MB, which this
 *  radio cannot spare, so incoming audio is converted to 375 Hz complex
 *  baseband as it arrives and only that is kept - 334 kB. Nothing is
 *  lost: the +-187 Hz that survive decimation already cover the whole
 *  200 Hz WSPR window.
 *
 *  All callbacks run on the worker thread. Handlers that touch LVGL
 *  must scheduler_put() into the UI thread rather than poking LVGL.
