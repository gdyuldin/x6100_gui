 *  WSPR demodulator and synchroniser
 *
 *  Turns audio into 162 soft values ready for the Fano decoder.
 *
 *  Why decimate to 375 Hz:
 *  a WSPR symbol lasts 8192 samples at 12000 Hz, so a direct FFT would
 *  need 8192 points. Decimating by 32 gives exactly 256 samples per
 *  symbol, and a 256-point FFT at 375 Hz has 1.4648 Hz bins - precisely
 *  the WSPR tone spacing. The four tones therefore land on four
 *  ADJACENT bins with no smearing. Same resolution, 32x less work.
 *
 *  Synchronisation: WSPR has no preamble, but every symbol carries one
 *  bit of a known sync vector (the symbol's low bit). We search for the
 *  time and frequency alignment where energy concentrates in the tones
 *  consistent with that vector.
